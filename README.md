# TCP Server/Client GUI App Using RSA

This is a 1-to-1 simple TCP Server/Client app written in C++ using Qt library.
## Compile and run
To compile it you need to either have the Qt IDE or have qmake installed.

For Arch Linux you can use **sudo pacman -S qt5-base**

For other distros or Windows, you can use the Qt installer from https://www.qt.io/

There are two folders, one is the Client app the other is the Server.

You need to compile both, if you have the Qt IDE, open two IDEs and compile and run using them.

Alternatively you can go where the source files are and run **qmake** command. This will create the executable.

## Implementation details can be found in the Papers folder.
